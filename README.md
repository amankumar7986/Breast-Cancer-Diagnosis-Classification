Confusion Matrix Mini-Project: Evaluating a Classification Model
This project provides a practical, step-by-step guide to understanding and evaluating a machine learning classification model using a Confusion Matrix and other key performance metrics. It uses the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to train a Logistic Regression model and then dives deep into analyzing its performance.

üìã About the Project
The primary goal of this mini-project is to demystify the process of model evaluation. By the end of this exercise, you will have a clear understanding of:

How to build a simple classification model.

How to generate and interpret a confusion matrix.

The meaning and importance of metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

The practical difference between Type I and Type II errors.

üíæ Dataset
The project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is included with Scikit-learn.

Features: 30 numeric, predictive attributes computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Target: Diagnosis (Malignant = 0, Benign = 1).

Samples: 569 total instances.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The Python script Confusion_Matrix_Mini_Project.ipynb) is structured into clear, sequential steps:

Data Loading & Exploration: The dataset is loaded, and its basic characteristics (shape, features, target distribution) are examined.

Data Splitting: The data is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. stratify is used to ensure both sets have a similar distribution of malignant and benign samples.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is initialized and trained on the training data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on the unseen test data.

Confusion Matrix Generation: A confusion matrix is calculated to compare the actual vs. predicted labels. It is then visualized as a heatmap for easy interpretation.

Metrics Calculation: Key performance metrics are derived from the confusion matrix:

True Positives (TP)

True Negatives (TN)

False Positives (FP) - Type I Error

False Negatives (FN) - Type II Error

Accuracy

Precision

Recall (Sensitivity)

F1-Score

Reporting: A comprehensive classification report is printed, showing the metrics for each class.
